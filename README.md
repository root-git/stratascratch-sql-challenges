# Mastering Hard StrataScratch SQL Interview Questions  

## Introduction

This project began as a personal initiative to prepare for SQL interviews. With several years of experience as a data analyst and frequent use of SQL in my daily work, I expected to breeze through the questions.

However, when tackling **StrataScratch's hard-level SQL challenges**, I quickly realized that my struggle wasn’t in writing SQL syntax — it was in **breaking complex questions into smaller, logical parts** and solving each part step by step before stitching them together into a complete solution.

By identifying this gap, I developed a more strategic and methodical approach. Over time, I was able to solve hard questions more smoothly, consistently, and confidently.

## Why This Matters

If you're also preparing for SQL interviews or learning how to approach complex SQL problems, I hope this project gives you:
- A real-world lens on how to **think like a problem solver**, not just a query writer
- Examples of **clean, well-documented solutions**
- A repeatable method to break down and tackle any tough SQL challenge

Let’s level up our SQL skills — one challenge at a time.

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL (PostgreSQL syntax)
- Python (for synthetic data generation)
- Google Colab (for notebook-based solutions)
- Git & GitHub (for version control and documentation)

##  How to Use

1. **Fork or Clone** this repository to your local environment or GitHub account.
2. Each challenge is contained in its own **Google Colab notebook** (`.ipynb` format).
3. Open the notebook directly in Google Colab.
4. Review the original problem, explore the step-by-step breakdown, and study the final SQL solution.
5. Modify or practice writing your own solution as needed.

Happy querying!
