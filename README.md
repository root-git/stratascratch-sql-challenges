# Mastering Hard StrataScratch SQL Interview Questions  

## Overview

This project began as a personal challenge to improve my SQL skills for interviews. But it quickly evolved into a deeper question:
How can technically complex SQL problems be reframed as business-driven questions?

Most SQL interview prompts emphasize logic and data manipulation. But in real-world analytics roles, stakeholders rarely ask for queries. They ask questions rooted in business goals.

I reimagined classic SQL interview challenges by framing each one as a real business request. The goal is to demonstrate how analysts can move beyond technical correctness and deliver insights that drive decisions.

## Why This Project Matters

As a senior data analyst, I already understood SQL syntax. But technical skill alone isnâ€™t enough. To make a real impact, you need to:

- Understand the business motivation behind a question
- Break down complex data problems into manageable components
- Translate query results into clear, actionable recommendations

Top analytics roles demand more than accurate queries. They require strategic thinking, stakeholder empathy, and the ability to connect data to business outcomes.

This project is designed to help build that mindset.

## What You'll Find in Each Notebook
Each notebook includes:

**A business-style framing of the original SQL interview prompt**  
Instead of starting with a technical challenge, I reframe it as a stakeholder request tied to business goals and decision-making.

**A clean, well-documented solution using PostgreSQL**
Each query is written with clarity and follows best practices. I explain each step to ensure the logic is easy to follow and adaptable.

**A breakdown of insights and potential stakeholder actions**
After solving the query, I interpret the results in a business context by highlighting what decisions the data can inform and what actions might follow.

The goal is not just to solve a coding puzzle, but to treat each challenge as a business problem requiring structure, clarity, and strategic thinking.
