# Mastering Hard StrataScratch SQL Interview Questions  

## Overview

This project began as a personal challenge to improve my SQL skills for interviews. But it quickly evolved into a deeper question:
How can technically complex SQL problems be reframed as business-driven questions?

Most SQL interview prompts emphasize logic and data manipulation. But in real-world analytics roles, stakeholders rarely ask for queries. They ask questions rooted in business goals.

I reimagined classic SQL interview challenges by framing each one as a real business request. The goal is to demonstrate how analysts can move beyond technical correctness and deliver insights that drive decisions.

## Why This Project Matters

As a senior data analyst, I already understood SQL syntax. But technical skill alone isnâ€™t enough. To make a real impact, you need to:

- Understand the business motivation behind a question
- Break down complex data problems into manageable components
- Translate query results into clear, actionable recommendations

Top analytics roles demand more than accurate queries. They require strategic thinking, stakeholder empathy, and the ability to connect data to business outcomes.

This project is designed to help build that mindset.

## What You'll Find in Each Notebook
Each notebook includes:

- The original SQL interview prompt to provide context and show the technical challenge as it was presented.
- Python code to generate mock data that lets you run and test queries in a self-contained environment without relying on external databases.
- A business-style reframing of the prompt that translates the technical question into a real stakeholder request focused on business goals and decision-making.
- A clean, well-documented solution using PostgreSQL with step-by-step explanations to help you follow the logic and apply best practices.
- A breakdown of insights and recommended stakeholder actions that interprets the query results in a business context and suggests how they can drive decisions.

This approach ensures each notebook is not just a coding exercise, but a full walkthrough from problem understanding to actionable insight.
